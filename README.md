Facial Recognition and Emotion Detection using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning-based system that can recognize faces and detect human emotions in real time. It combines facial recognition with emotion classification to enhance security, monitoring, and human-computer interaction.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Real-time face detection using OpenCV

Facial recognition using CNNs / pre-trained models (FaceNet, VGGFace, ResNet, etc.)

Emotion detection (Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, Neutral)

Works on images, video streams, and webcam input

Built with TensorFlow/Keras / PyTorch for deep learning

ðŸ”¹ Workflow

Detect face from image/video input

Extract facial features

Perform recognition (identity verification)

Classify emotion using trained deep learning models

ðŸ”¹ Applications

Security & Surveillance

Healthcare (patient emotion monitoring)

Education (student engagement tracking)

Smart AI Assistants / Human-Computer Interaction
